This repo is dedicated solely to my learning process with Python framework called **Selenium**.
This framework is created to help developers automatically test their web applications. 
All .py files are working solutions to challenges in [Selenium Testing course on stepik.org](stepik.org/course/575/)
I might add my own projects related to this topic but unrelated to the course progression in the future (TODO :^))
Thanks for checking it out. Peace ^^

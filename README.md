This repo is dedicated solely to my learning process with Python *framework* called **Selenium** and **PyTest** *library*.
These are created to help developers automatically test their web and other applications.
All .py files are working solutions to challenges in [Selenium Testing course on stepik.org](stepik.org/course/575/)
I might add my own projects related to this topic but unrelated to the course progression in the future (TODO :^))
Thanks for checking it out. Peace ^^
